## Installation

There are 2 ways: [with Node.js](#with-node) and one  [Git Submodules](#git-submodules)

### with Node

This is the recommended approach.

We assume that you already setup your working environment with **hardhat** + **foundry** as specified in [foundry 's guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/hardhat) or [hardhat 's guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-and-foundry) and `cd` into it

```bash
cd my-project;
``` 

1.  Add the `redprint-forge` using your favorite package manager, e.g., with Yarn:

```sh
yarn add -D redprint-forge
```

2. Adding `remappings.txt` with following line:

```txt
@safe-contracts/=node_modules/redprint-forge/lib/safe-smart-account/contracts
@redprint/=node_modules/redprint-forge/
```

### git submodules

## What is it for ?

One of our Swiss army knife toolset: **redprint-forge** is a developer-friendly framework/library in solidity to modify & deploy OPStack â€™s contracts in a modular style.

The features include:

- Type-safe smart contract deployment

- Re-usable  smart contract deployment and testing pipeline

- Standardized framework, minimizing developer mistake and enhancing better security

- All-Solidity-based so no context switching, no new scripting syntax in other languages

Together with [`Redprint Wizard UI`](https://github.com/Ratimon/redprint-wizard), which is a code generator/ interactive playground oriented for OPStack development, it does not only help novice developers to deploy OPStack's smart contracts to deploy on OP mainnet, but also help them to use generated deployment script in their own projects.
